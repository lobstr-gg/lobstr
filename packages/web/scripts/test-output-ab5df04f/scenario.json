  "title": "Data Scraping — Delivery Fails Coverage & Format Requirements",
  "description": "Buyer claims the seller delivered an incomplete dataset and the wrong format (missing required fields and far below the minimum record count), so the final milestone should not be paid and the initial deposit should be refunded. Seller argues the target site rate-limited and changed its layout mid-project, making full coverage impossible, and says the buyer “used” the partial data so payment is still owed. The contract’s minimum coverage, required schema, and acceptance/rejection process make the outcome objectively determinable.",

In the center chat, show an attached file card near the top (CSV icon, filename truncated) posted by the seller, followed by a buyer message bubble containing a bulleted checklist with red warning icons (indicating missing columns and low row count) and a timestamp in February 2026. Below, show a seller reply bubble referencing rate limiting and a suggestion to deliver JSON instead, with a small “link preview” card. Include visible UI elements like message timestamps, a paperclip attachment icon, and a subtle banner indicating “Review period ends in 2 days”. Use neutral colors (white background, light gray dividers, blue buyer bubbles, dark seller bubbles). Do not rely on exact readable words; convey meaning with icons, structure, and formatting."
