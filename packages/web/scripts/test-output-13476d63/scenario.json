  "title": "Data Scraping — Dataset Fails Coverage & Format Requirements",
  "description": "A buyer hired a seller to scrape and deliver a U.S. real estate agent dataset with strict coverage, deduplication, and format requirements. The seller claims the work was delivered on time and that the buyer’s later complaints are about “nice-to-have” enrichments and normal scrape variability, so the final payment should be released. The buyer argues the delivered CSV misses key required fields, fails the minimum coverage threshold, and contains excessive duplicates, making it non-compliant under the contract’s acceptance criteria.",

      "content": "[{\"heading\":\"PARTIES\",\"body\":\"This Data Scraping Services Agreement (the \\\"Agreement\\\") is entered into on 2026-02-03 between (1) Evelyn Harper (\\\"Buyer\\\"), operating as Harper Growth Studio, and (2) Ming Jiao (\\\"Seller\\\"), an independent data contractor. The services are procured and paid in LOB tokens via the LOBSTR marketplace on Base (Ethereum L2).\"},{\"heading\":\"SCOPE OF WORK\",\"body\":\"Seller will produce a dataset of U.S.-based residential real estate agents sourced from public brokerage/agent profile pages and reputable directories (no paywalled sources). Deliverables: (A) Primary dataset in CSV format named \\\"us_real_estate_agents.csv\\\"; (B) Data dictionary in PDF named \\\"data_dictionary.pdf\\\" describing each column and allowed values; (C) Source list in CSV named \\\"source_domains.csv\\\" with the domains scraped and record counts per domain. Required fields per record: full_name, brokerage_name, city, state, phone (E.164 preferred), email (if publicly listed), profile_url, source_domain, license_id (if publicly listed), last_seen_date (YYYY-MM-DD). The dataset must be limited to the United States and residential agents; exclude commercial-only agents when identifiable.\"},{\"heading\":\"COMPENSATION\",\"body\":\"Total fee: 12,000 LOB. Payment schedule: 4,000 LOB escrowed/released upon project start (non-refundable once work begins); 5,000 LOB released upon delivery of all deliverables; 3,000 LOB released upon Acceptance (as defined below). Any on-chain transfer fees are borne by the paying party. No additional fees are due unless a written change order is agreed in the LOBSTR order chat.\"},{\"heading\":\"TIMELINE\",\"body\":\"Project start date: 2026-02-03. Interim sample: Seller will deliver a 200-row sample CSV by 2026-02-07 for format confirmation. Final delivery of all deliverables due by 2026-02-14 23:59 UTC via LOBSTR order file upload or a mutually agreed link. Buyer review window: 3 calendar days after final delivery (through 2026-02-17 23:59 UTC).\"},{\"heading\":\"ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA & DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS\",\"body\":\"Acceptance is conditioned on meeting all of the following measurable criteria: (1) Record count: at least 10,000 unique agent records. (2) Coverage: at least 85% of records must contain non-empty values for each of the following: full_name, city, state, profile_url, source_domain. (3) Contactability: at least 60% of records must contain a phone number OR email (either is sufficient) sourced from the public profile page (no guessing). (4) Deduplication: duplicate rate must be <= 3% as measured by exact match on profile_url OR by (full_name + brokerage_name + city + state) normalized; duplicates beyond 3% constitute nonconforming delivery. (5) Format: CSV must be UTF-8, comma-delimited, with one header row; dates must be YYYY-MM-DD; state must be 2-letter USPS abbreviations. Buyer will provide written notice of nonconformity within the review window with at least 3 specific examples; Seller has a single cure period of 5 calendar days to remedy and resubmit. If Seller fails to cure within the cure period, Buyer may reject and the 3,000 LOB Acceptance payment will not be released.\"},{\"heading\":\"ADDITIONAL TERMS (QUALITY, SUBCONTRACTING, & DISPUTES)\",\"body\":\"Quality Standard: Seller warrants that data is collected from public webpages without bypassing access controls and will not fabricate emails/phones. Subcontracting: Seller may not subcontract scraping or data enrichment without Buyer’s written consent in the LOBSTR order chat; breach is grounds for rejection. Late Delivery: If final delivery occurs after 2026-02-14 23:59 UTC, Buyer may impose a 5% reduction of the remaining unpaid amount per 24 hours late, capped at 20%, unless Buyer agreed in writing to an extension. Disputes: In the event of dispute, the Contract and the LOBSTR order records will control.\"}]"

Main panel shows a chronological chat with message bubbles and file upload cards.

Show a later message from the buyer with an attached small thumbnail of a spreadsheet preview (columns visible but text not legible) and a highlighted section indicating missing values and duplicates. Show the seller responding with a message bubble that references “delivered 10k+ rows” and “scrapes vary; email optional”, and the buyer referencing “Acceptance criteria: 85% coverage and <=3% duplicates” with a visible quote-style block. Include subtle UI elements: message timestamps, a ‘Review window ends’ banner, and an escrow/payment widget on the right showing three milestones with the last milestone pending.
