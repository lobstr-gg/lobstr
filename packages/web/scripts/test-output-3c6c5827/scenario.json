  "description": "Buyer (Riya Nand) hired Seller (Caleb Hart) to scrape February 2026 product listings from two competitor sites and deliver a deduplicated CSV plus a short methodology note. Buyer claims the delivery is missing one entire site’s data and was delivered in JSON instead of the required CSV, so the final milestone should be refunded. Seller argues the Buyer changed scope by asking for additional fields and that the delivered dataset is “equivalent,” so payment is still due.",
